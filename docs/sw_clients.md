# My Clients

In the DMECC menu, navigate to "Clients" > "My Clients".

This is where you will find a list of your clients (example below).

![myclient list view](img/sw_myclients_listview.PNG "Example of a 'My Clients' List")

>The clients in this table may not be all of the clients in the organization; your DMECC administrator (or manager) chooses which clients you have access to. If you do not see any clients listed in this table, or if you think someone is missing from this table, contact your organization's DMECC administrator so that they can give you access.

### Viewing Client Details
When you are granted access to client information, you can **click on the blue folder** (see "My Clients" image above) to view important details about the client. Here is an example of a ficticious client's details page:

>Note: Your organization's DMECC administrator enters the client's details into the system. If you think any missing details should be added, contact your administrator.

Use the "Back to My Clients" button at the bottom of the page to get back to your list of Clients.

# Plan of Care
If there is a green toolbox icon next to the blue folder (see image above), that means the client has an active Plan of Care. Click on this icon to open up that client's Plan of Care.
