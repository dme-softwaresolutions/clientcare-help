# Service Tasks

### Service Task List

Service Tasks are defined by your organization's "Primary Site Adminstrator" (usually a manager).

Each service task corresponds directly to a 'Service Type'. Your organization administrator can add a 'default time', which is an estimation of how long it will take to complete that task.
They can also add a description, to provide any extra details.

Service tasks are used by administrators to create a Plan of Care.

### Inactive Tasks

If a service task is out of date or no longer being used, it can be set as "inactive" by your administrator.
Inactive tasks cannot be used to create new Plans of Care, but they will still remain in any existing Plans of Care.
