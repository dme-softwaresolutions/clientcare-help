## Locking Work

Work-group records much be approved by an administrator (or manager) before they can be included in your organizations monthly reports.
When you are satisfied with the contents of your work-group record, please lock the record.

> To Lock a work-group record, click the **blue lock button**.

Once a work-group record has been locked by a Support Worker, an administrator can approve the record.

*Tip: If you need to unlock a work-group, contact your administrator. Administrators can un-lock work-group records as long as they have not already been approved.*

## Editing Work

If you need to make any changes to your work-group records, you can do so here.

> To Edit a work-group record, click the **green pen-and-paper button**.


## Deleting Work
